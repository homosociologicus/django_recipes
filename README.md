# <center>[Recipes - Django Project](https://mikebayt-django-recipes.herokuapp.com)</center>

This is my first project using Django framework. The repo contains source code for the project. If you wish to check out the project, you can go to the [site](https://mikebayt-django-recipes.herokuapp.com) where you can see it in production. It is not pretty, but then again my goal was to develop the backend and to deploy the app.

The idea came from
[Corey Shafer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p),
but I decided to create a recipes app instead of a blog. Maybe sometime
my food photographer friend will use it and start up a whole business, who knows...

Anyway, apart from Django itself, I also used

- [Heroku](https://mikebayt-django-recipes.herokuapp.com) for deployment
- [GitHub Python template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) for `.gitignore`
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) HTML templates
- Forms from [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms) library
- [Python Pillow library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Corey Shafer's snippets](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Django_Blog/snippets)
