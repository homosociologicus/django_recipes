# Recipes - Django Project

This is my first project using Django framework. The repo contains only the content of the project, i.e. no CI/CD, etc. If you wish to check out the project, you should also use your own `SECRET_KEY` :)

The idea came from
[Corey Shafer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p),
but I decided to create a recipes app instead of a blog. Maybe sometime
my food photographer friend will use it and start up a whole business, who knows...

Anyway, apart from Django itself, I also used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) HTML templates
- Emmet snippets
- [Corey Shafer's snippets](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Django_Blog/snippets)
- Forms from [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms) library
